    "Given an integer array nums of size n, return the number with the value closest to 0 in nums. If there are multiple answers, return the number with the largest value.\n",

    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: nums = [-4,-2,1,4,8]\n",
    "Output: 1\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "The distance from -4 to 0 is |-4| = 4.\n",
    "The distance from -2 to 0 is |-2| = 2.\n",
    "The distance from 1 to 0 is |1| = 1.\n",
    "The distance from 4 to 0 is |4| = 4.\n",
    "The distance from 8 to 0 is |8| = 8.\n",
    "Thus, the closest number to 0 in the array is 1.\n",
    "Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: nums = [2,-1,1]\n",
    "Output: 1\n",
    "Explanation: 1 and -1 are both the closest numbers to 0, so 1 being larger is returned.\n",
